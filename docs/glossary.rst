    AB
    
        The AB photometric system defines the zero points of the filters from a constant energy distribution against frequency.

    Central wavelength

        The central wavelength between the two points defining the FWHM. 

        
    Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM)

        The full width (in micron) of the filter, measured at half its maximal transmission.


    Photometric system

        Defines the reference spectrum used to define the zero points of the filters. 

    ST
    
        The ST photometric system defines the zero points of the filters from a constant energy distribution against wavelength.
        
    SVO

        The Spanish Virtual Observatory (SVO) is a project that aims to provide the astronomical community
        with a set of tools to facilitate the access and analysis of astronomical data.

    Vega
    
        The Vega photometric system defines the zero points of the filters from the spectrum of the star Vega.
